      <h1>A leather journal Rishikaa lost</h1>

      <p>
        I tried to recreate the journal Rishikaa lost in her childhood with
        code. In order to utilize translate() and rotate() we learned in the
        class, I drew an open journal which leave space for interaction and
        movement. I also apply mouseIsPressed and keyIsPressed to enhance the
        interaction. They can be found at the line 7-10 and line 1946-1949. When
        pressing the key, the whole journal will rotate, and while mouse is
        placed on the sheet of the journal and pressed, the sheet can be torn
        off with the movement of the mouse. The code is pretty long since the AI
        file I created contains lost of curves.

      <h1>Design Process</h1>

      <p>
        First, I designed a journal in the form of an svg so that i could use
        the 'secret tool' provided by Munus, However, I met problems while
        converting the svg into p5.js code. Then with the suggestion of Munus, I
        switch to Figma and succesfully convert the drawing.
      </p>

      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.global/37ceb013-f438-4f12-b04d-aa6a3298d270/Process1.png?v=1694453200273"
          alt="Process"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        In order to reach the effect of pages being torn off, I created two
        layers of pages inside the journal so it won't look wierd when the
        yellow sheet of paper were moved away. The I try to find the group of
        code that correspond to the part I wanted and then adding transltate()
        and rotate(). The most chaallenging part is the since the code is
        generated by the converter, it is quite hard to change the coordinates
        of the curves so that using translate and rotate together is not that
        successful.
      </p>

      <h1>Reflection</h1>

      <p>
        If the path could be more simply, it might be easier for me to find the
        group of codes I want and the coordinates of curves could be less for me
        to revise in order to use translate().Also, the effect of tearing the
        page of the journal is a bit of rigid. Hopefullig i could make it looks
        better after learning more.
