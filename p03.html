      <h1>Ripples Clock</h1>

      <p>
        For this project, I use the number of ripples to present Hour (12-hour
        timing since this looks prettier), the number of rings per ripple to
        represent minutes(using 10 minutes as an interval). To avoid the
        situation that nothing is shown when the minutes is single digit, the
        point in the middle represent single digits. For example, if there is 3
        points when pressing the mouse, That means it is around 3 AM/PM o'clock,
        if there is 4 ripples and each ripple has 1 point and 2 rings, that
        means it's about 4:20 (need to minus the single digit ring). The
        rotation of the rings are based on the second() and I used lerp() to
        make the rotation looks smoother. I kind of like the motion when it lerp
        from 0 so I make the angle reset to 0 everytime the mouse is released.
        Also, if moving the mouse while pressed, you can fast forward the time or
        rewind it.

      <p>
        I first drew a draft and write down the parameter I may need to use and
        their relationship to time. Then I use some for loops to create the
        ripples and their respective rings. The process is pretty succesful
        after planning out the parameters i need to use. I am pretty satisfied
        with the final result but there are still 2 problems I want to
        imporve.First is that I don't want the ripples to overlap but I couldn't
        find a way to do this due the the random() function. Second is that I
        want the ripple to fade away while mouse is released.
