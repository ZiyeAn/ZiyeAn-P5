      <h1>Kirby Generator</h1>

      <p>
        In this project, I have decided to create a Kirby generator inspired by
        the game Kirby™ and the Forgotten Land. In the game, Kirby can transform
        into different shapes by sucking in objects. To avoid creating
        unattractive Kirbys, I have chosen to preset their appearance instead of
        making their eyes and limbs random. To transform Kirby, simply press and
        release the mouse.
      </p>

      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img

          alt="Process"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        Realizing this idea has proven to be extremely challenging. I researched
        and applied noise in the transformation process of Kirby. I also
        attempted to customize the function to make drawing Kirby easier.
        However, I encountered difficulties when trying to utilize random
        methods. Although I wrote functions for the transformed status of Kirby,
        I am unable to incorporate them as assets and use random(). As a result,
        I sought out tutorials and used random() to generate images that I drew.

      <h1>Reflection</h1>

      <p>
        I learned a lot in this project and I would like to learn more about
        class and assets to solve the problems that I met. Also, it would be
        nicer if there were suggestions on how to simplify the code.
